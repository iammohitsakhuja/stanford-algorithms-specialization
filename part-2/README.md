# Part - 2

This part contains the following algorithms/concepts:

- Week 1:
    1. Graph operations like: BFS, DFS, Topological sorting, Strongly Connected
        components
- Week 2:
    1. Dijkstra's algorithm for computing shortest paths from a source vertex to
        every other vertex
- Week 3:
    1. Binary Search Tree
    1. Heap (Priority Queue)
    1. Median Maintenance (contains performance comparison between tree & heap)
- Week 4:
    1. 2Sum problem (Implemented using Hash table in Python, JS and C)
